# Bayesian Circular Lattice Filters (BCLF)

The time-varying vector autoregressive (TV-VAR) model is a well-established model for multivariate nonstationary time series. However, the large number of parameters results in a high computational burden in the TV-VAR model fitting. Hence, the Bayesian Circular Lattice Filters are a computationally efficient algorithm to sort this issue out.
